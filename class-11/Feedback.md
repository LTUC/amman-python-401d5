# Weekly Feedback

- Feel that grades are more important than learning
  - Why? - No Response
- TAs not helping enough / 'correctly'
  - What does ideal help from TA look like for you?
- Bring back reviews at beginning of class
  - Students can volunteer code for review else i'll choose
- More code; less concept
  - If you find a good resource, use it and share it

## Bad trends

- Not submitting whiteboards for the code challenges
  - Time
    - Try code challenge first before lab
    - You do not need to complete everything by 11:59pm; you need to start everything before the deadline
- Not adding the correct information to the README.md
  - Did not understand what the checklist was
  - Not Enough Time
  - Chicken and Egg problem and PR
- Not adding meaningful commit messages to the git repo 'a' 'addsd' 'sad' will get you fired in your job, do you think we should accept it here?
- Using built-in data structures and methods to avoid building out the correct structure for the data structure implementation
- Lack of class participation
- Not adding __ methods

## The bad news

- 1 resubmit is back; TAs tried but some students are abusing the generosity and resubmitting the same assignment 7 times
- Deadline will remain at 11:59pm; changing it will just waste everyone's time.

## General Feedback

- Problems in GoG
  - Test Failures
    - Integration Test Failures
    - Understand your code
    - Understand your tools

    - Assertion Errors
    1. Read and understand the error message
    2. Determine the cause of the error

## General Suggestions
