## Datascience and Numpy

### Why?

- Data Science is a ***huge*** field, both deep and broad.
- Transform our data from an abstract form to a more intelligible and sometimes interactive form.

### What?
 - Data Science is about telling a story with your data, usually to support decision making.
 - Data Science is an umbrella term covering many disciplines:
    - Business Administration
    - Exploratory Data Analysis
    - Machine Learning
    - Artificial Intelligence
 - Python is major player in this space due to a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.
 - The basis of many of these libraries is a numerical calculation library called Numpy.

 ### How

 - Learning the basic of numpy since it is a core library for data science.
